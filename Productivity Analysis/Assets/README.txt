Productivity Analysis

FUNCTIONALITY:
This application tracks which apps are in the foreground window and measures how long they are used. Other anlytics are tied to each application
including mouse movement and keystrokes to determine input categorization of working, browsing, or leisure. Input is also tracked for individual
apps like words typed and enter presses.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Analytics are displayed for all apps on a page using two pie charts and two timelines. Analytics are displayed for individual apps in the form
of two pie charts and a table of analytics.



SOURCES:
-Raw input for keyboard input outside of unity was accomplished using scripts from the open source project:
https://github.com/Elringus/UnityRawInput
-Pie charts were made from the inspiration of a YouTube series from "Board to bits games"
-Determining the application was inspired by the following StackOverflow page titled "How do I get the title of the current active window using
C#":
